## Setting Up a Docker Environment for Laravel

To set up a Docker environment for Laravel, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Laradock repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Laradock/laradock.git environment-laradock
```

2. Install Laravel 10 by running the following command:

```
composer install
```

3. Add the necessary templates and tables by running the following commands:

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

4. Create an API for CRUD operations on the User model.

5. Create a tool to manage the User table.

To access the Docker workspace, run the following command:

```
docker exec -it --user laradock environment-laradock-workspace-1 bash
```

That's it! You now have a Docker environment set up for your Laravel project.
